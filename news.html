      <h2>⚽ Local League Update</h2>
      <p>The Bees FC recently made some roster moves, releasing several players including Mabuza 'Msona' Bongumusa, Mzwakhe 'Mbappe' Magagula, and Sihle Majola. They're rumored to be signing new talent, such as Ndumiso Mabena, Dingaan Maphosa,and Junior Nyathi. Interestingly, Tshediso Patjie won't be joining the team due to their preference for younger players who fit their quick passing style. Coach Humphrey Mlwane mentioned they needed someone with more energy, particularly in the attacking midfield position.

Tshediso Patjie, a 34-year-old midfielder, has had a notable career playing for teams like Moroka Swallows, Sekhukhune United, and Baroka FC. He recently spoke about his departure from Moroka Swallows, citing issues with outstanding payments.Patjie seems focused on helping Baroka FC secure promotion to the DStv Premiership.</p>
